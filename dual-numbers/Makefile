# Aldor Makefile for module {MODULE} generated by Aldor intellij plugin

# Note that intellij does not depend on much from makefiles.
# The plugin expects that:
# - Each source file is in a directory containing a makefile
# - The makefile supports .as -> .ao, .as -> .abn
#
# Feel free to edit/replace this file - it's just here to get you started.
